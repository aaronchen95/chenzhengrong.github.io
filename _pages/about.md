I am a second-year Electrical and Computer Engineering student at Georgia Tech. With a solid background in power system, computer science and data science, my goal is to develop a more sustainable, intelligent and secure energy system creating a convenient and environmental-friendly life for everyone. My research interest lies in cyber-physical system, power system operation and cybersecurity, renewable energy integration, microgrid control, and machine learning.
